# Cirrhosis
The purpose of this task is to analyze Cirrhosis using Machine Learning. Cirrhosis is the late stage of scarring of the liver, which can be caused by liver diseases and conditions such as hepatitis and chronic alcholism. 
Features that play a role in predicting Cirrhosis are Age, Sex, Cholesterol, Bilirubin, Platelets, and so on.  
In order to analyze the impact of Cirrhosis, it was decided to use 'Status' as the target.  This enabled the data to focus on the patient (c), patient censored due to liver treatment, and death.
The data showed that there was a higher number of people among the censored group, second was death and last was the group with treatment.  ![download](https://github.com/ddy623/Cirrhosis/assets/129712664/f97ab0cc-432a-4b0d-a3a9-8f4a7f554c10)
